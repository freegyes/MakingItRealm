As a journalist I create all the time - so sometimes I actually feel like it's factory work. And what I consider art or 'true' creation for myself - drawing, painting, writing poetry or somethingliterature-ish - well, I have very limited time to do any of that, or at least I allocate very limited time for it. So here we go, too much creative energy goes to work to be creative outside work? Great.
