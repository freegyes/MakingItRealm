# MakingItRealm
## Development
The site is running on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 

To build on localhost, run
  > jekyll serve

You'll need to have Ruby version 2.7.2. An article on how to make it happen on your Mac is [here](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac).

## Deployment
When you push your changes to the `main` branch, GitHub Pages will build and deploy the site automatically.
