After more than a year of waiting, [Ádám](/authors/adam_freisinger.html) and I finally published the second episode of [our podcast](https://anchor.fm/masodik-hallasra). This time around, we investigated the world of mistakes, trying to find out why we make them, how we cope with them, and how we might avoid them. I'm pretty proud of this one; I hope you'll enjoy it.

**P.S.**: The link at the top points to Spotify, but of course, you can find our podcast wherever you listen to podcasts. Search for _Második Hallásra_.
