November 2022, we celebrate 1 year of [fxhash](https://fxhash.xyz){:target="_blank"} and show this with a trophy made out of 365 gifts with 365 unique wrappings. Each box contains mind-blowing generative art. 
The fxhash-box at the bottom is using a reverse-engineered version of [FXHASH Generative Logo](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/fxhash-generative-logo){:target="_blank"} (the first piece ever minted on fxhash) with special thanks to [@ciphrd](https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/ciphrd){:target="_blank"} for being so kind to allow me to use it. The whole technique is described in [Pattern formation using Dividing-Aggregating Walkers](https://ciphrd.com/2021/03/17/pattern-formation-using-dividing-aggregating-walkers){:target="_blank"}.
