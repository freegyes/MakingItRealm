Arthur, my Hong Kong colleague convinced our team to go to the Wednesday horse race at Happy Valley. I don't have any particular interest in gambling, but it was worth going just to see and hear the horses running. They are a beautiful subject, but I have realised I am still more interested to observe and capture what the people are doing at the race track.
