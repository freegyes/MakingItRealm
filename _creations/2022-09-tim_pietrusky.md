For the party "Urban Bass Bungle" organized by [Banana Bass Music](https://bananabassmusic.com/en/){:target="_blank"} (of who am I part of) & [Stonecreek Crew](https://www.instagram.com/stonecreekcrewdd){:target="_blank"} I created a 3D scene with Blender using some nice jungle-plant models that I bought from blendermarket.com. The scene was converted into glTF so that I could use it as a Three.js module in [modV](https://modv.vcync.gl/){:target="_blank"} where it was made audio-reactive. During the night I used the jungle for multiple artists, as it was the whole theme of the event. The picture shows the jungle in combination of a 3D logo from [2xAA](https://2xaa.fm/){:target="_blank"}, who played a spontaneous dnb-flavored chiptune set on his Gameboy's to close the main floor (I invited Sam to be the guest visuals for the event as we had two floors).
