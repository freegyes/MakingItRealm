When [HighThere](https://soundcloud.com/highthere-music){:target="_blank"} released his new track [The Knights of Ren](https://soundcloud.com/highthere-music/the-knights-of-ren){:target="_blank"} I was inspired to generate a [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIg8H-yRV3U){:target="_blank"} by using the waveform data of the song in combination with [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/){:target="_blank"}. The end result has 512 3D cubes that are spread from left to right and they are changing their size & color based on how loud a certain frequency is.
