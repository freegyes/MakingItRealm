The band-project [schickmalzwo](https://schickmalzwo.de){:target="_blank"} was in need for a new key visual to be used for the events in 2022, so their SVG-logo was converted into a 3D object in [blender](https://www.blender.org/){:target="_blank"} and loaded into [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/){:target="_blank"} as glTF to get some dynamic properties like hue or rotation. The image shows the logo combined with other effects in [modV](https://modv.vcync.gl){:target="_blank"} as part of the live performance of schickmalzwo @ Susiâ€™s Bday Bash, Rhoischnook, Mainz, Germany on 20.08.2022.
