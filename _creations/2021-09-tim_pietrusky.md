After a recommendation for [Bespoke](https://www.bespokesynth.com/docs/index.html) by [Borsi](authors/zoltan_borsos.html) I created some audio tracks and was in love with the audio visualization that is automatically generated in the background of Bespoke. I recorded a video of this visualization, extracted 30 images of this video, trained an AI via [playform](https://playform.io) using their pre-defined "freeform" model and picked one of the generated images, which was then combined in [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) with one of the original images from Bespoke.
