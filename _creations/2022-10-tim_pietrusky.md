After reading [Building a Vaporwave scene with Three.js](https://blog.maximeheckel.com/posts/vaporwave-3d-scene-with-threejs/){:target="_blank"} by [Maxime Heckel](https://twitter.com/MaximeHeckel){:target="_blank"} I was super inspired to generate a pseudo random landscape based on a single plane in ThreeJS.
The mountains and the road in the middle are sculpted out of the plane by using OffscreenCanvas to generate a low resolution grayscale displacement map: A dark color means no change to the plane = small mountains / flat road, where a light color means that the vertices are elevated = high mountains / road.
The colourful grid texture is also generated with OffscreenCanvas: It has the same size as the displacement map, so that the lines match the displaced vertices. Just the resolution is much higher.
The last part is a bloom effect (which is based on a shader) that lets the landscape glow... sometimes even too much.

This is the first generative art piece by NERDDISCO, each iteration is totally unique as itâ€™s generated by using the hash of a block in the tezos blockchain as the seed.
