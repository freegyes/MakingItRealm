Last minute submission, I didn't have the time to do this properly. Fortunately when I was doing some preliminary renders with my shiny new Cycles X, @Aniko told me that the low res version looks cool. I hastily agreed then animated it, downsampled and made a gif from the render. Let's see if we can properly show gifs here. :)
