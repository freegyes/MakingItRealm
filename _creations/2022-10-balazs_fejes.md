My colleague Ryoichi took me around his hometown and the province of Nagano on a chilly but sunny Sunday afternoon. We visited a friend's apple orchard and tasted the most amazing apples I've ever had. I also got to sample some exquisite grapes. The rice harvest was mostly completed everywhere, leaving bales of rice straw on the fields. We've waited for the Golden Hour at a nearby winery and used the setting sun's light to make car beauty shots of Ryoichi's Suzuki Jimny four-wheeler. What a perfect Sunday!
