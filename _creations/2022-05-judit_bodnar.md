I rarely feel the urge to share my articles here. But this month <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">shit</span> life happened, and gave me a bittersweet opportunity to write with some well-hidden personal expertise. So the case is, I am a diehard Depeche Mode fan - but as in the Hungarian journalist community being enthusiastic about something is considered a seriously uncool thing, I don't particularly advertise my expertise in this very niche topic. But this month, I wrote not one but two Depeche Mode-related articles, one on a happy occasion, one on a very sad one. A [birthday](https://24.hu/kultura/2022/05/09/dave-gahan-depeche-mode-60-hatvan-eves-heroin-tuladagolas-elvonokura){:target="_blank"} and a [death](https://24.hu/kultura/2022/05/27/andy-andrew-fletcher-depeche-mode-dave-gahan-martin-gore){:target="_blank"}. It was an opportunity to think about life, death and immortality. The articles are in Hungarian, sorry!
