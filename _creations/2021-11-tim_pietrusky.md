When [hic et nunc](https://hicetnunc.art) celebrated 500000 minted objects on the Tezos blockchain, I was inspired to create an abstract 500000 using [GLSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language) in [modV](https://modv.vcync.gl/). The 5 is made out of 5 sdBox that are rotating in different directions and the 000000 are made ouf of sdBoxFrame that are rotating in themselves forever. The texture is an infinite mandala ([nd-infinite-mandala](https://github.com/NERDDISCO/nd#nd-infinite-mandala)) that is based on the work from [Liam Egan](https://codepen.io/shubniggurath). 

Besides the number 500000, this piece also represents the ever changing landscape of art. Eventually everything will dissolve and reappear in another dimension.

It's also my first ever NFT.
