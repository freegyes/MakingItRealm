I've been experimenting with Blender 3.0 geometry nodes. This is an animation I rendered yesterday. The vegetation is procedurally generated on a noisemap-displaced plain, all of it is geometry nodes. I had a camera focus glitch at the end which was not intentional but I left it there because I felt it was good. I was also thinking about adding some camera shake using Ian Hubert's shakify plugin... but I haven't yet figured out how to bake the shake into the animation in order for my render farm to be able to use it.
