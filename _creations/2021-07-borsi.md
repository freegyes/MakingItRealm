â€œArrakis teaches the attitude of the knife - chopping off what's incomplete and saying: 'Now, it's complete because it's ended here.'
There are no mistakes, only happy accidents. I hope. This project started off as an animation but sadly only one image made the cut until the deadline. I reached a point where I can't really see what I'm doing up until the point I rendered the whole thing and it's 47 hours later. :D
