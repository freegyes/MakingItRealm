This month I took a bunch of photos from our Mood Octopus and used RealityCapture to stitch together the images into a passable 3D model. Then I cleaned it up and started working on a scene with the little (now big) guy for next month's Realm submission. I have to clean it up a little further and fix whatever's happening with its hair simulation (yeah, since it's a plush toy, I decided to generate some fur on the little fella). Added some camera shake and panting and "tada", here's a strange dramatic scene.
