Finally, after two and a half years at home, we are traveling. The first two weeks of our trip is in Bangkok. My photographic mission is to explore the small block just behind our apartment hotel, filled with interesting architecture, colours, and people. Some of these streets appear to be Chinese, and it's an interesting mix of cultures, old and new, and I am loving it.
