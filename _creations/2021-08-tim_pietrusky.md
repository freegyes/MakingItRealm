A music video created for the song ["Take You Down" by "Hasky & Mr. Kato"](https://soundcloud.com/bananabassmusic/hasky-mrkato-take-you-down). The original inspiration by the musicians was an ocean filled with jellyfish, but as I wasn't able to find a commercial-ready jellyfish-shader, I took a different direction. In [modV](https://modv.vcync.gl/) I created an eye that is made out of all oceans that ever existed and will ever exist: The goddess of all dimensions. When ever you see her, there is no way to escape, you will be taken down. 

The video is generated by using the audio from the song as an input to change different visual modules that are combined to create the eye.
