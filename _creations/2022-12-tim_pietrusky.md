My friends Patrick and Jasmin run the co-working space [Das Dorf](https://dasdorf.online/){:target="_blank"} in Mainz (Germany) and every year they host an awesome christmas-party among friends. Jasmin asked me 2 days before the event (which happened on 2022-12-09) if I could bring some xmas-like decoration with me. As I already used up my decoration at home (I ❤️ xmas), I created a winter wonderland in ThreeJS, which was projected onto a wall in their office.
