Sometimes, I just want to hear a short story in the evening. Not being part of a bigger arc, no commentary, no any other fuss, just the story. As I have already listened to the ones that I could find in Hungarian, I recorded myself reading a story I've just found in a book written by a contemporary author, and uploaded to a Telegram channel called [Felolvas√≥](https://t.me/+Bm2ypsF_k0I4ZDc0){:target="_blank"} (it's in Hungarian). Maybe more will follow.
