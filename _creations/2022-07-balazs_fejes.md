Even though I have read about George Town in Penang that it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site, I wasn't really prepared for the beauty I've found there. It's a mix of colonial architecture, Chinese, Indian, Malaysian style old buildings, wonderfully intact. I'd love to spend more time there and do a more comprehensive photo project about this hidden gem of a city.
