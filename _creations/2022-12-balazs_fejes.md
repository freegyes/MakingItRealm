Christmas feels different in Asia. It's still sunny and warm here:  everything is green. The Christmas installations at malls, sometimes lavish, sometimes limited by their budgets, inspire shopping and selfie-making for about two months. Then they get promptly replaced by the Lunar New Year decorations. Still, kids love Christmas the same way everywhere: school and other club performances and the countdown to the magic of opening presents. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
