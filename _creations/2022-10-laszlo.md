October was an arts & crafts month for me. I've built a LEGO set I wanted to build for a long time and continued on my journey to become a somewhat capable miniature painter. The models you see above are works in progress (apart from one), but I felt like sharing them anyway. I'm learning to celebrate small victories. :) For high resolution images, [check out this album](https://imgur.com/a/TgdmHtX).
