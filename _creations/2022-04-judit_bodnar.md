As far as I know, this drawing technique is called zentangle. I do it on paper as well, sometimes mixed with watercolour. My boyfriend loves it when I draw and he asked me to draw on this cheap acoustic guitar he has. It was a very long process, several years, due to lack of time. But this Easter I finally finished, yay!
