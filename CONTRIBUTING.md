# Contributing to the Making It Realm

First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute! 🤗

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the [Making It Realm](https://www.makingitrealm.space/), both as a creator and as a developer. These are mostly guidelines, not strict rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](https://www.makingitrealm.space/code-of-conduct.html). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [hello@makingitrealm.space](mailto:hello@makingitrealm.space).

## How Can I Contribute?

### 👩‍🎨 Contributing as a Creator 

🗓 **Make sure that your submission arrives by the first Saturday of the month, the latest**. Our current schedule sets the virtual exhibitions live on the first weekend of every month. 

**Note**: If you get anxious when you hear expressions like Forking, Branches and Pull Requests, just reach out to [hello@makingitrealm.space](mailto:hello@makingitrealm.space) and we'll help you set up your creation.

- Fork the [Making It Realm repository](https://github.com/freegyes/MakingItRealm).
- Create a new branch from the latest `202X-XX` branch and name it `submission-202X-XX/author`.
- Find the `_templates` folder and use the files inside as templates.
- If you **already have an author file** in the repo:
  - Copy the [`template_creation.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freegyes/MakingItRealm/main/_templates/template_creation.md) file to the `_creations` folder and rename it to `YYYY-MM-your_name.md`. The date should be the past month, so when you submit for an exhibition that starts on the first weekend of June, add `-05-`.
  - Add an image for your creation to the `/images/202X-XX` folder as `202X-XX-author_name.jpg`. If the folder does not exist yet, create it.
  - Edit the contents of the template file and remove the initial comments.
- If **this is your first time** submitting: 
  - Copy the [`template_author.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freegyes/MakingItRealm/main/_templates/template_author.md) file to the `_authors` folder and rename it to `your_name.md`.
  - Add a portrait of yourself to the `/images/authors` folder as `your_name.jpg`.
  - Edit the contents of the template file and remove the initial comments.
- Send a pull request with all your changes to the latest `202X-XX` branch.
- You are ready!

### 👩‍💻 Contributing as a developer 

If you are part of the core maintainer team, work in the master repository. If you are not, fork the [Making It Realm repository](https://github.com/freegyes/MakingItRealm) first.

Use the `development` branch to branch off with your `feature-xxx` branch, and send the pull request to the master repository's `development` branch when you're ready.

### 🐞 Reporting Bugs, Requesting Features and Discussing Ideas

Bugs, requests and ideas are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/freegyes/MakingItRealm/issues) in this repository. Skim through the open issues, emote, comment, or feel free to open a new one.
